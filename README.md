## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- **Bonus**: Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
- **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/)

### What I learned

Selecting the stack for this project has been tricky. Originally I picked NextJS. I thought it would be a good idea to create this project full stack from the beginning and I already had used NextJS. Mid project I realized that I needed to learn more about databases and backend. At that point I was more interested in practicing more with React so I decided to just use local storage. Using local storage with NextJS quickly becomes a mess of hydration errors. At that point I decided to just use React and Vite to get more practice building React apps. Further ahead I added React Router to the stack, which brought some additional challenges.

The most important lesson that I have learned doing this challenge is that no matter what stack you pick you're gonna face many difficulties. If I went back I would just keep on with my initial idea of using NextJS and learn more about backend development.
